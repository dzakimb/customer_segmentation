# Customer Segmentation Using KMeans

## Overview

This project aims to perform customer segmentation on a dataset from a local shop using the KMeans clustering algorithm. The goal is to group customers based on their purchasing behavior in order to gain insights into their preferences and behaviors.

The project explores the dataset through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), utilizes the pandas library to clean and organize the data, and applies KMeans clustering for customer segmentation. The insights gained from this analysis can be used for targeted marketing strategies, personalized offers, and improving customer experience.

**Note**: This project is inspired by the example project ["Customer Segmentation Clustering"](https://www.kaggle.com/code/karnikakapoor/customer-segmentation-clustering) by Kaggle user [Karnika Kapoor](https://www.kaggle.com/karnikakapoor).

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found at [link to the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datascientistanna/customers-dataset). It contains customer-related information such as age, gender, annual income, and spending score. This information is used to understand customer behavior and segment them into groups.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Exploration**: The project begins with a thorough exploration of the dataset using various visualizations and statistical techniques to understand its structure and characteristics.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed using the pandas library. Missing values, if any, are handled, and the data is organized for further analysis.

3. **KMeans Clustering**: The KMeans clustering algorithm is applied to segment customers based on their attributes. The optimal number of clusters is determined using techniques such as the elbow method or silhouette analysis.

4. **Visualizing Clusters**: The clusters obtained from the KMeans algorithm are visualized using scatter plots or other appropriate visualizations to analyze the distribution of customers among different segments.

5. **Interpreting Results**: Insights are drawn from the clustered groups, identifying patterns and characteristics of each segment. This information can be used for targeted marketing strategies and other business decisions.

6. **Conclusion**: The project concludes with a summary of findings, the significance of the analysis, and potential applications for the insights gained.
